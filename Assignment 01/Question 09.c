/*
Metro City Planners proposes that a community conserve its water supply by replacing all the
communityâ€™s toilets with low-flush models that use only 2 liters per flush. Assume that there is about
1 toilet for every 3 persons, that existing toilets use an average of 15 liters per flush, that a toilet is
flushed on average 14 times per day, and that the cost to install each new toilet is $150. Write a
program that would estimate the magnitude (liters/day) and cost of the water saved based on the
communitys population.
